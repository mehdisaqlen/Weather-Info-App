# Weather Info App

A simple app built with Next.js.

This app gives you information about the weather of any city you look for.

If you want to use the app, you can download the source code and edit it and make it even better.

Clone the repository and then open it up in your code editor (i.e. VSCode).
In terminal run following command.

```bash
npm install
```

After installing all the dependencies, go to
[Open Weather Map](https://api.openweathermap.org), create an account and grab a free API key.

Use that unique key; put it in `.env` file and use it as an environment variable.

After all run the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Here we go :), the app is up and running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
